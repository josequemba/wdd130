    <h2>Jos√© Eliud</h2>
    <h2>Quemba</h2>
    <p>Hi there, I go by Eliud and I was born in Luanda, Angola in 1996. I also lived in 
    United States for two years and tha's where I was able to learn English and Spanish.</p>
    <p>As I grow up, I started to develop a certain pation with computers and technologies, I 
    was the type of kid thta would spend more time with computers than spending time with friends. 
    When I was attending high school, I had a big desire to study stuff about computers,but 
    because there was no great schools in my area that taught that, I decided going to buisness
    school since it was avaluable in my area.</p>
    <p>When I head from a friend that was on the Pathway program, that it could help me to get a 
    degree on Software Development thourgh BYU Idaho, I was so excited to know more about it, 
    and so I started my researches about the program and ended up applying to The Pathway 
    program and now starting this first semester at BYU Idaho online, is a great acomplishment 
    to me.</p>
    <p>Learning How to program feels like part of my life now and it is even a hobby to me beside 
    reading and playing sports. BYUI makes it easy because it is all online and I can do it from
    my country where opportunities like that may not exist. And I strongly believe that it will
    help me to boost my career on buisness and even  help me to get better jobs.</p>
    <p>To finish I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since 2014,
    and went on my mission on 2017 and got back from my mission on 2019. One of my favorite scriputes
    is in D&C 60:2 - Where the Lord show how he is concerned with us about how we use our talent, 
    showing his love for us and how engaged he is on our personal progress.
