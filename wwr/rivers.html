                <div class="learn-title"><h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2></div>
                <p class="learn-content">Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The 
                    Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of 
                    the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they 
                    never left.</p>

                <p class="learn-content">Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly 
                    sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy 
                    beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.</p>
                    
                <p class="learn-content">Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest 
                    undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, 
                    and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are 
                    good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the 
                    late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

                <p class="learn-content">Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land 
                    anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone 
                    cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip 
                    runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding
                     scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, 
                     and great whitewater opportunities.</p>

                <p class="learn-content">Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days.</p>

                <p class="learn-content">Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the 
                    uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>

                <div class="learn-title"><h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2></div>
                <p class="learn-content">This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river 
                    trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
                    
                <p class="learn-content">Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make
                     one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating 
                     whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
                    
                <p class="learn-content">CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are 
                    technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river 
                    variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so 
                    we often refer to both.
